I have implemented a route planning problem using UCF. The search algorithm can be broadly classified into -

  1. Uninformed Search

  2. Informed Search
     
Here, the graph problem comes into Uninformed Search. 

Uniform Cost Search or abbrevated as UCF is the algorithm that works by expanding lowestcost node. It uses Priority Queue for the implementation. It gives the most optimal solutionamong other uninformed search algorithms. 

The Path cost comes to be **9 + 2 + 9 = 20** and the path choosen is *[1 → 3 → 6 → 5]*
